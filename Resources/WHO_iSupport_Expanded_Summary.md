## 1. Overview, Purpose and Context

### 1.1 Why iSupport Was Created

Dementia is a major cause of impairment that affects a person's memory, thinking and behaviour, and interferes with one's ability to perform daily activities. It affects people worldwide, in particular older people. Globally, families provide the majority of care to people with dementia. The impact of dementia is significant to the individual who lives with dementia, their families, societies and countries, both in financial terms and human costs.

Being a carer for someone with dementia may affect one's physical and mental health, well-being, and social relationships. Long-term care systems must account for the significant emotional, financial and social impact of caregiving on families and relatives, while addressing the needs of people with dementia. This includes providing carers with access to education, skills training, respite and social support through affordable, evidence-based resources.

To address this need, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed iSupport, an online skills training and support programme for carers of people with dementia. The iSupport manual was created so carers who do not have access to the internet, or who prefer a printed format, can also benefit from the tool.

### 1.2 Policy Alignment

The programme aligns with the **Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017–2025**, which envisions a world in which dementia is prevented and people with dementia and their carers receive the care and support they need to fulfil their potential with dignity, respect, autonomy and equality.

### 1.3 Evidence Base

iSupport is grounded in WHO's **Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP)** guidelines for carers of people with dementia. mhGAP aims to scale health and social care services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for all countries, with a focus on low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). iSupport was developed based on evidence related to the feasibility and effectiveness of carer training and support interventions, both in person and online. The programme was developed in collaboration with international experts in the field of caregiving for people with dementia and internet-based interventions, and reflects the voices of actual carers. For more information: Pot AM, Gallagher-Thompson D, Xiao LD, Willemse BM, Rosier I, Mehta KM, Zandi D, Dua T. iSupport: a WHO global online intervention for informal carers of people with dementia. *World Psychiatry*. 2019.

### 1.4 Core Goals

- Improve carers' knowledge and caregiving skills
- Help carers cope with dementia symptoms
- Help carers take care of themselves
- Enable people with dementia to live in the community
- Prevent or reduce carer stress

### 1.5 Target Audience

**Primary:** Family members, relatives, friends, and other informal carers of people with dementia.

**Secondary:**
- Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) providing skills training, support and/or information to carers
- Health and social care workers providing care and information to carers
- Private sector representatives involved in the development of health technologies for dementia, dementia health care service delivery or health care insurance

### 1.6 How to Use the Manual

Each module is divided into individual lessons. All lessons follow a consistent structure:
- **Overview:** Why the lesson is important, how it will help the carer, and what they will learn
- **Brief reading sections:** New information presented in digestible portions
- **Descriptive examples:** Real-world scenarios using named characters from diverse cultural backgrounds
- **Multiple-choice comprehension checks:** "Check Your Understanding" questions with detailed answers at the end of each lesson
- **Reflective activities:** Structured worksheets and planning exercises
- **Relaxation activities:** Stress-reduction exercises integrated throughout

Carers can work through the entire manual sequentially or select the most relevant lessons for their current situation. They can also return to individual lessons at any time.

### 1.7 Other Uses of iSupport

Although iSupport is primarily a self-help tool, WHO encourages broader use:
- Supplemented by guidance from volunteers or health care workers for greater impact
- Used to structure educational or support group meetings for carers
- Used as a resource tool for self-help group participants
- Used by health care workers to assist and support carers in their practice

### 1.8 Adaptation

The iSupport manual represents a template that can be adapted to national or local contexts and needs. An adaptation and implementation guide is available. WHO owns the copyright — countries/communities must contact WHO at whodementia@who.int to request a copyright license for adaptation. The programme is currently being field-tested in multiple countries.

## 3. MODULE 1: Introduction to Dementia (1 Lesson)

### 3.1 Learning Objectives
1. What is dementia?
2. What causes dementia?
3. What happens to people with dementia as the disease progresses?
4. What to do if you think that the person you care for has dementia?
5. How to reach out for help?
6. What is the focus of this manual?

### 3.2 What Is Dementia?

Dementia occurs as a result of a disease process that increasingly damages the brain over time. Key facts:
- Dementia affects all groups of society and is **not linked to social class, gender, ethnic group, or geographic location**
- Dementia is **not a part of normal ageing**
- Although more common among older people, younger people can also be affected
- It is a disease, not a character flaw

### 3.3 Types of Dementia (Causes)

**Alzheimer's disease** — The most common cause. It destroys brain cells and nerves, disrupting the transmitters that carry messages in the brain, particularly those responsible for storing memories.

**Vascular dementia** — Occurs where blood vessels are damaged, the supply of oxygen to the brain fails and brain cells die. Symptoms can occur suddenly (following a stroke) or over time (through a series of small strokes). Accounts for **20–30% of all dementia cases**.

**Dementia with Lewy bodies** — Similar to Alzheimer's, caused by deteriorating and dying nerve cells. Named after abnormal deposits of protein (Lewy bodies) in brain nerve cells. Accounts for approximately **10% of all cases**. Approximately half of people with Lewy body disease also develop signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

**Fronto-temporal dementia** — Including Pick's disease. Damage is usually concentrated in the front part of the brain. In the beginning, **personality and behaviour are more affected than memory**.

**Rarer causes** — Alcohol-related dementia, dementia due to HIV/AIDS, and others.

### 3.4 Disease Progression

Every person is unique and dementia affects people differently. No two people will develop the same difficulties in exactly the same way. It is not just the brain damage that determines how dementia affects someone, but also other factors including the individual's **personality, life course, general health and functioning, and living environment**.

Dementia symptoms can range from minor memory loss to severe difficulties in memory and thinking that make it impossible to manage daily activities without help.

**Early stage symptoms:**
- Memory problems — forgetting recent events, repeating questions
- Disorientation with time
- Getting lost in familiar places
- Difficulty making decisions
- Struggle with money management
- Forgetting appointment dates
- Difficulty expressing themselves
- Misplacing common objects
- Declining social activity
- Mood changes

**Middle stage symptoms:**
- Increasing forgetfulness (forgetting names, events, appointments)
- Growing need for help with daily activities like shopping, dressing, and washing
- Difficulty with conversation and following instructions
- Increasing reliance on carer for routine tasks

**Late stage symptoms:**
- May not recognize relatives or friends
- Significant behaviour changes that can be distressing
- Need for full-time personal care
- Difficulty with mobility, eating, and all daily functions
- Communication becomes extremely limited

### 3.5 What to Do If You Suspect Dementia

The **first and most important step** is to ensure the person sees a medical doctor. The doctor will examine body and brain functioning. It is critical to rule out other **treatable conditions** that can mimic dementia symptoms:
- Depression
- Urinary tract infection
- Medication side effects
- Vitamin deficiencies
- Brain tumors

Only a medical doctor can determine whether memory problems are truly caused by dementia. The manual emphasizes: while friends/family and iSupport can offer support, they **cannot replace a medical examination**.

### 3.6 How to Reach Out for Help

- You cannot provide all care alone
- Reach out to family, friends, and professional organisations
- Contact the **Alzheimer's Association** in your country (www.alz.co.uk/associations) for local resources
- iSupport can support you as a carer alongside professional medical care

### 3.7 Key Takeaways (Module 1)

- Dementia affects the brain and is a disease, not normal aging
- It is common, especially in older people
- Seeing a medical doctor is the essential first step
- Carers must take care of themselves, not just the person with dementia
- Carers cannot provide all care alone — reaching out is essential

## 4. MODULE 2: Being a Carer (4 Lessons)

### 4.1 Lesson 1: The Journey Together

**Learning objectives:**
1. How may your roles change over time?
2. How to stay connected with the person you care for?
3. How to plan pleasant activities and relaxation?
4. How to involve others in caregiving?
5. How to plan for the future?

#### Changing Roles Over Time

- **Early stage:** Carer and person with dementia can still enjoy many activities together. The carer may start assisting with everyday tasks like making shopping lists, managing medications, accompanying to appointments.
- **Middle stage:** More help is needed — giving medications, taking the person to appointments, assisting with daily tasks like cooking, cleaning, and shopping. The person may need supervision.
- **Later stages:** Personal care becomes necessary — bathing, toileting, dressing. Some tasks become challenging and stressful for carers. Full-time supervision may be required.

#### Staying Connected

The sooner carer and person with dementia start talking about the disease and its effects, the better. Communication becomes more difficult as dementia progresses. Tips include:
- Use simple sentences
- Stay in control of your feelings
- Create time for each other
- Focus on what the person *can* still do
- Maintain physical affection and closeness
- Continue shared routines and rituals

#### Planning Pleasant Activities and Relaxation

As caregiving becomes more time-consuming, carers often neglect self-care. Carer burnout is a real risk. The lesson emphasizes that planning pleasant activities and relaxation is essential for sustained caregiving — not a luxury but a necessity.

#### Involving Others

Caregiving can challenge friendships and relationships. Carers commonly feel misunderstood. Key messages:
- It's critical to let friends and family know when a break is needed
- Caregiving is sometimes too big a job for one person
- Practical scenarios are presented (e.g., arranging coverage when the carer has a doctor's appointment at the same time as needing to bring the person with dementia elsewhere)

#### Planning for the Future

Discussions to have **early** — while the person with dementia can still express preferences:
- Who does the person prefer to provide care?
- Planning the costs of future care needs
- Bathing preferences (male/female helper, professional vs. family)
- What does the person want to continue doing independently for as long as possible?
- Wishes about residential care if staying at home is no longer possible
- What aspects of home/community/facility care are important?
- Who should be in charge of finances when the person can no longer manage?
- How does the person want to be treated at the end of their life?
- Are there medical treatments the person wants to receive or refuse?
- What does the person want when eating is no longer possible? (e.g., feeding tube)
- Particular fears or concerns about medical treatments?
- Preparation of **advance directives** that accurately reflect the person's wishes, in accordance with local law
- Informing each other and the doctor about preferences and decisions concerning medical treatment

Writing down responses is strongly encouraged.

#### Maintaining Intimacy

The manual addresses how couples can maintain closeness as dementia progresses, acknowledging that intimacy and relationships change but need not be abandoned.

### 4.2 Lesson 2: Improving Communication

**Learning objectives:** Seven practical communication skills for interacting with someone living with dementia.

#### Skill 1 — Check Ability to Hear and See
- Ensure hearing aids work and glasses are clean
- Rule out sensory barriers before assuming comprehension problems are dementia-related
- Visit an audiologist or eye specialist if needed

#### Skill 2 — Get Attention in a Respectful Way

**Good approaches:**
- Call the person by a name they recognize (first name or nickname)
- Speak clearly, slowly, at comfortable volume
- Position yourself face to face, at eye level
- Gently tap a hand, arm, or front of shoulder to get attention

**Approaches to avoid:**
- Never stop and hold the person forcibly
- Never approach from behind and touch their shoulder (startling, may cause fear)
- Never raise your voice or shout

#### Skill 3 — Keep It Simple
- Reduce background noise (turn off radio/TV)
- Don't make phone calls while talking to the person
- Ask one question at a time
- Give simple, step-by-step instructions
- Don't multitask during conversations
- Move to a quiet place for important conversations
- Limit distractions in the environment

#### Skill 4 — Take the Person Seriously
- Don't talk about the person when they are in the room as if they are not there
- Never use "baby talk" — always treat with dignity and respect
- Ask questions they can answer with "yes" or "no" (closed-ended questions)
- Be patient — people with dementia need more time to find words
- Ask permission before helping them finish sentences
- Allow them time to respond (count to 5 between phrases)
- Don't interrupt (they may lose train of thought)
- Allow them to interrupt you (or they may forget what they want to say)

#### Skill 5 — Pay Attention to Reactions
- Learn to read facial expressions and body language
- The person may communicate emotions (happy, angry, sad, scared) non-verbally when verbal communication becomes difficult
- Observe non-verbal communication carefully
- Use visual cues and demonstrate tasks
- Written notes can be helpful when spoken words are confusing
- Increase your own use of gestures and non-verbal communication

#### Skill 6 — Give Compliments

**Positive statements** (make the person feel good):
- "You look beautiful"
- "You are very helpful"
- "I love having you around"
- "You have a great smile"
- "Thank you for helping"

**Negative statements** (cause harm — avoid these):
- "What are you doing?! Stop it!"
- "You should be ashamed"
- "You are driving me crazy"

Always thank the person for helping, even if the results aren't perfect.

#### Skill 7 — Show Compassion
- Show understanding even when questions are repeated
- Remember it is the disease, not the person
- Try different approaches — if distraction doesn't work, acknowledge feelings directly
- People with dementia have the right to grieve their losses
- **Example (Elena):** When Elena keeps asking about her deceased husband, her brother eventually acknowledges her grief, shares photos, and talks about the husband — rather than attempting to distract her. This compassionate response honours her feelings.

#### Communication in Later Stages

As verbal abilities decline, communication shifts to non-verbal methods — facial expressions, touch, tone of voice, and body language become the primary communication channels. The person may still understand emotions and respond to gentle touch, calm voice, and warm presence even when words no longer work.

### 4.3 Lesson 3: Supported Decision-Making

**Learning objectives:**
1. Why is it important to support the person with dementia to make their own decisions?
2. How can you support the person with dementia to make everyday decisions?
3. How can you prepare instructions that reflect the wishes of the person living with dementia?

#### Why Support Is Needed

Decision-making becomes difficult due to:
- Memory loss (forgetting information needed for decisions)
- Problems with thinking or describing thoughts
- Difficulty with complex decisions

However, like everyone else, **people with dementia have the right to participate in decisions affecting their lives**. Supporting autonomous decision-making improves self-esteem and independence.

#### Making Everyday Decisions

**Example — Manuel and Maria (choosing clothes):**

The manual asks: "What is the best way to make sure Manuel wears clean clothes, without taking over his decisions?"

- **Best response:** Before bed, Maria asks Manuel what he wants to wear the next day, then asks him to lay the clothes out. This way Manuel is encouraged to do things he is still able to do.
- **Acceptable response:** Maria chooses clothes but asks Manuel to lay them out (good that he's involved, but better if he chose).
- **Poor response:** Maria chooses clothes and gives them directly to Manuel. This takes control away.

**When Manuel starts worrying the evening before:** Instead of eliminating his involvement, Maria shifts the timing — asking him in the morning instead, so he doesn't worry all night. She still supports his decision-making.

#### Simplifying Decisions as Dementia Progresses

- Limit the number of choices (e.g., "Do you want the blue or black trousers?" instead of open-ended questions)
- Time discussions for when the person is calmer and less anxious
- Use visual aids to help the person understand options
- Present information in simple, concrete terms connected to the person's experience

#### Complex and Future Decisions

For medical, legal, and financial decisions:
- The person should be supported with clear, concrete explanations of consequences
- Advance directives should be prepared early
- Key questions to address (see Section 4.1 above on Future Planning)

### 4.4 Lesson 4: Involving Others

**Learning objectives:**
1. Why is it important to involve others in providing care?
2. How to ask for help?
3. Why is it important to ask for help in an effective way?

#### Why Involvement Matters

Caregiving can lead to isolation, exhaustion, and breakdown. Sharing responsibilities with family, friends, and professional services is essential — not a sign of weakness.

#### Three Styles of Asking for Help (Through Li's Example)

Li needs a weekly break from caring for her mother. Her sister could help.

**Example 1 — Effective/Assertive (RECOMMENDED):**
Li approaches her sister and honestly explains that she is feeling overwhelmed, that she needs a regular weekly break, and asks if her sister could care for their mother for one hour on a specific evening. She keeps her sister's interests in mind while standing up for her own needs. This is respectful, honest, and specific.

**Example 2 — Passive (NOT EFFECTIVE):**
Li decides to attend a weekly class but does not discuss the importance of having a break. When she asks her sister who says "Sorry, I have no time," Li cancels her class. Li is not being honest about her feelings, tries to avoid conflict, and does not stand up for herself. Her sister may not even be aware that Li is feeling overwhelmed.

**Example 3 — Aggressive (NOT EFFECTIVE):**
Li approaches her sister by saying, "I'm sick and tired of you not doing anything! You never have time to help me care for our mother!" Li becomes angry but doesn't clearly communicate her needs. Her sister may not be aware Li is overwhelmed because Li didn't mention it. This approach is disrespectful and unlikely to lead to help.

#### Making a Plan to Involve Others

The lesson provides a structured worksheet:
1. **Who** would you like to ask for help?
2. **What** would you like to say?
3. What would you do if the person does **NOT** want to help?
4. What would you do if the person **does** want to help?

#### Overcoming Common Barriers

- **Guilt** about asking for help — Sharing responsibility makes you a better carer
- **Belief that no one else can provide adequate care** — Others may do things differently, and that is acceptable
- **Difficulty trusting others** — Start small, build trust gradually
- **Pride or cultural norms** — Seeking help is strength, not weakness
- **No one available** — Consider professional in-home care services, support groups, local Alzheimer's Associations

## 5. MODULE 3: Caring for Me (3 Lessons)

This module focuses entirely on the carer's own wellbeing — a critical but often neglected aspect of dementia caregiving. The module's position (before daily care and behaviour management) reflects its importance: **you must care for yourself to effectively care for another**.

### 5.1 Lesson 1: Reducing Stress in Everyday Life

**Learning objectives:**
1. The importance of relaxing
2. Seven different relaxation techniques
3. Relaxing at any time and any place

#### Why Stress Reduction Matters

**Diana's example:** Diana takes care of her husband Dan who has dementia. She feels increasingly tense. A friend advises her to try to relax. Diana says she doesn't have the time or energy. Her friend explains that relaxation doesn't take much time, and might give Diana renewed energy. Diana tries a breathing exercise and later says: "Thank you for the good advice. Although I still have a lot to do, I feel less tense."

**Benefits of relaxation:**
- Makes you feel less tense
- Gives renewed energy
- May make it easier to get tasks done
- Does not have to take much time

#### Self-Assessment Scale

Before and after each exercise, carers rate their tension on a **1–10 scale** (1 = very small amount of tension, 10 = very high amount of tension). This helps them evaluate which techniques work best.

#### Seven Relaxation Exercises

**Exercise 1: Basic Breathing (~5 minutes)**
- Sit up straight or stand up straight
- Put both feet flat on the surface
- Focus on breathing
- Put hand on stomach to feel inhale and exhale
- Exhale from mouth and pull in stomach as much as possible
- Follow breathing for a few breaths, then stop
- *Caution: Not ideal for those with breathing difficulties*

**Exercise 2: Mindful Breathing (~5 minutes)**
- Sit straight in chair, relax face and shoulders
- Bring hands to stomach, breathe into it
- Breathe in for 4 counts and out for 8 counts at comfortable pace
- Stomach should expand with each inhale and contract with each exhale
- Return to normal breathing, spend one minute observing self
- Practice listening to own thoughts without negative judgement
- If mind wanders, refocus on breathing and meditation

**Exercise 3: Neck Movements (~5 minutes)**
- Move slowly and with attention
- Bend neck forward and backward
- Inhale while lifting head up and back; exhale while dropping chin to chest
- Rotate chin from side to side
- Inhale when chin is in centre; exhale when looking to side
- Drop ear towards shoulder
- Inhale when in centre; exhale when dropping ear to shoulder
- Repeat 5 times
- *Increases blood flow to brain and decreases neck tension*

**Exercise 4: Number Counting (~5 minutes)**
- Sit or lie down comfortably in a quiet place
- Breathe slowly — at least 3 seconds in, 6 seconds out
- Focus on breathing and lower stomach until feeling calm
- Say the word "relax" whenever breathing out
- Tell yourself you will count down from 20 to 1
- Tell yourself you will double your relaxation for each count and will be totally relaxed at 1
- Count down: deep breath → say "20" → breathe out slowly → say "relax" → deep breath → say "19" → breathe out → say "relax" → and so on
- Repeat with eyes closed

**Exercise 5: Imagery (~5 minutes)**
- Only imagine places, people and things you like
- Imagine what you can hear, feel, smell, and/or taste in that place
- Think of very specific details (how does the surface feel? how does it smell?)
- Sit or lie down comfortably in quiet place
- Breathe slowly (3 seconds in, 6 seconds out)
- Focus on breathing until peaceful inside
- Imagine being in that place, surrounded by things or people you like
- Repeat with eyes closed

**Exercise 6: Total Stretching (~10 minutes)**
- Stand up or do in chair
- Take deep breath all the way to bottom of stomach, slowly let it out
- Feel tension drain from body with each exhale
- Gently reach arms out to the sides (as though touching the walls)
- Relax shoulders and stretch
- Reach arms out in front — feel back and shoulder muscles loosen
- Reach up as high as possible, push arms toward sky (trying to reach the sun)
- Repeat: sides → front → up
- Roll shoulders back, then forward (3 times each direction)
- Shrug shoulders up then push down (3 times)
- Deep refreshing breath, exhale all remaining tension

**Exercise 7: Progressive Muscle Relaxation (~10–15 minutes)**
Systematic tensing and relaxing of every major muscle group. Each group: tense for 5 seconds, relax for 10 seconds. Say "relax" as you release. May be helpful to inhale while tensing and exhale while relaxing.

Muscle groups in order:
1. Right hand and forearm (make a fist)
2. Left hand and forearm
3. Right upper arm (bring forearm up to "make a muscle")
4. Left upper arm
5. Forehead (raise eyebrows as high as they will go)
6. Eyes and cheeks (squeeze eyes closed)
7. Mouth and jaw (open mouth wide, as if yawning)
8. Neck (face forward, pull head back slowly looking at ceiling — *be careful*)
9. Shoulders (bring up towards ears)
10. Shoulder blades/back (push shoulder blades together, chest forward)
11. Chest and stomach (breathe in deeply, filling lungs)
12. Hips and buttocks (squeeze muscles)
13. Right upper leg (tighten thigh) → repeat left
14. Right lower leg (pull toes towards you — *slowly, avoid cramps*) → repeat left
15. Right foot (curl toes downward) → repeat left

*Caution: Not recommended for those with injuries or physical limitations — try another exercise.*

#### Relaxing at Any Time and Any Place

**Diana's continued example:** Diana often feels tense when there is a long line in the store. She decides to do the breathing exercise while waiting. Afterwards, she feels less tense.

**Key principles:**
- You can relax anywhere and at any time of the day
- Set a goal: do a relaxation exercise at least once a day
- Plan a specific time to relax (use a reminder if needed)
- Even brief exercises make a difference
- Regular practice improves effectiveness

#### Troubleshooting When Relaxation Doesn't Help

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Could not focus | Try again at another time |
| Need more practice | Do the exercise regularly to build skill |
| Exercise didn't suit you | Try a different exercise |
| Exercise was too short | Try a longer exercise or extend the duration |
| Still not helping after these tips | Try a pleasant activity instead (see Lesson 2) |

---

### 5.2 Lesson 2: Making Time for Pleasant Activities

**Learning objectives:**
1. The importance of pleasant activities
2. How to create a list of pleasant activities for yourself
3. How to engage in pleasant activities

#### Why Pleasant Activities Matter

Pleasant activities are important because caregiving can last a long time and doing pleasant activities can help you relax and continue providing care. They can be small things such as going for a walk or talking to a friend.

#### Three Carer Profiles

| Profile | Approach | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| **Amy** | Dedicates all time to caregiving, never takes time for herself | Becomes increasingly tired, less capable of providing care |
| **Jose** | Asks his sister to help so he can nap and read a magazine | Maintains energy, continues effective caregiving |
| **Umit** | Hires professional carer three times a week; uses time for walks and newspaper | Sustained, high-quality caregiving with personal wellbeing |

#### Overcoming Barriers to Pleasant Activities

| Barrier | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "No time" | Even small pleasant activities fit into a day; some take only minutes |
| "No energy" | Doing something enjoyable actually restores energy rather than depleting it |
| "No money" | Many pleasant activities are free — walking, visiting a friend for tea, reading |
| "Not in the mood" | Mood typically improves after doing something pleasant; not doing anything worsens mood |
| "Physical limitations" | Many activities can be done regardless — reading, games, talking to friends |
| "Guilt" | Taking breaks makes you a better carer; self-care is not selfishness |

#### Activity Ideas for Carers Alone

Crossword puzzles, watching TV, visiting friends/family, cooking, listening to music, crafts, reading, napping, shopping, walking, exercising, taking a warm bath, hobbies, gardening, religious or spiritual practices, talking on the phone with friends.

#### Activities to Do Together with the Person with Dementia

Listening to music, playing instruments, taking relaxing walks, reading stories/newspaper articles/poems aloud, going out to eat, cooking and preparing snacks, watching birds or animals, handiwork or crafts, looking at photos, watching clouds/exploring nature, recalling and discussing happy memories, having friends over, simple arts and crafts, singing together.

#### Making Activities Achievable

- Rate activities on a scale from "unachievable" to "very achievable"
- Start with the most realistic ones
- Begin with small goals and build up over time
- Rethink activities to make them more accessible
- Ask someone to help with day-to-day tasks to free up time
- Assess whether skipping certain household tasks would really matter
- Do one activity at a time
- Use an agenda or calendar for time management

---

### 5.3 Lesson 3: Thinking Differently (Cognitive Reframing)

**Learning objectives:**
1. How do thoughts affect your feelings?
2. How to identify unhelpful thoughts?
3. How to change unhelpful thoughts into helpful ones?

#### Core Principle — The ABC Model

It is **not an event itself** that determines your feelings — it is **how you think about the event**. Unhelpful thoughts lead to negative feelings; helpful thoughts lead to better emotional states.

- **A (Activating event):** Something happens
- **B (Belief/Thought):** How you interpret it
- **C (Consequence/Feeling):** The emotion that results

**Example — Jo and Max (lost keys):**
Max (who has dementia) can't find his keys and insists Jo can't leave.
- *Unhelpful thought:* "I can never leave anymore" → Feeling: Miserable, trapped
- *Helpful thought:* "Max has dementia and is sometimes worried when he loses things. I can take some time to help and then go." → Feeling: Calm, compassionate

#### Identifying Unhelpful Thoughts (Aryan's Example)

**Unhelpful thoughts carers commonly have:**
- "I am a bad carer if my family member is not always happy"
- "Maybe the person living with dementia will become better" (unrealistic expectation)
- "No one understands how hard it is to care"
- "No one can provide the care the way I do"

**Helpful replacement thoughts:**
- "Making time for myself helps me provide better care"
- "Asking others for help can help me share the duties of care"
- "Dementia is a disease, it is not my or anyone else's fault"

#### How Thoughts Influence Feelings (Xavier's Example)

Xavier's friend Gabriel offers to help care for Xavier's father.

- *Unhelpful interpretation:* "Gabriel thinks I'm a bad carer" → Feelings: angry, guilty, lonely, upset
- *Helpful interpretation:* "If Gabriel thinks I need help, he must care about me and my father" → Feelings: supported, cared for

#### Practical 5-Step Process for Changing Thoughts

1. **Identify** the stressful event
2. **Recognize** your feelings
3. **Identify** the unhelpful thought
4. **Challenge** the thought and create a helpful alternative
5. **Notice** how the new thought changes your feelings

#### Key Takeaways

- You cannot always change what happens, but you can change how you respond
- Unhelpful thoughts increase stress; helpful thoughts reduce it
- Practice identifying and replacing unhelpful thoughts regularly
- Don't blame yourself or the person with dementia for difficulties
- Share your feelings with others
- Make time for yourself — this is essential, not optional

## 6. MODULE 4: Providing Everyday Care (5 Lessons)

### 6.1 Lesson 1: Eating and Drinking — More Pleasant Mealtimes

**Learning objectives:**
1. How to help the person with dementia enjoy mealtimes?
2. How to help the person with dementia eat?
3. What if the person with dementia does not eat?
4. How to help the person with dementia eat at gatherings?

#### Creating Pleasant Mealtimes

- Reduce distractions during meals (turn off TV, minimize noise)
- Serve meals at consistent times to establish routine
- Consider the person's food preferences and cultural background
- Use contrasting colours for plates and table to help the person see food
- Provide adaptive utensils if needed (larger handles, non-slip mats)
- Cut food into small, manageable pieces
- Sit with the person and eat together when possible — never isolate from family meals
- Allow adequate time — don't rush meals
- Give gentle, step-by-step verbal cues if the person forgets how to eat
- Promote a good, warm atmosphere

#### Supporting Independence

Even as dementia progresses, encourage the person to feed themselves as much as possible. Finger foods can help maintain independence when utensils become difficult. Engaging the person in meal preparation tasks (setting table, washing vegetables, stirring) maintains skills and promotes self-worth.

**Example — Siya:** Siya, a former housewife, lost interest in eating after her husband's death. By involving her in simple meal preparation tasks, her interest in food returned.

#### Managing Common Challenges

| Challenge | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| Forgetting to eat | Establish regular meal and snack schedules |
| Eating too fast | Serve one course at a time |
| Playing with food | Redirect gently |
| Refusing to eat | Try different foods, temperatures, and times |
| Decreased appetite | Make meals visually appealing, offer small frequent portions |
| Spilling food | Use non-slip mats, adaptive utensils, cups with lids |

**Example — Shang:** Shang spills food at family meals and the family becomes irritated. The lesson teaches that Shang should not be isolated — instead, adapt the environment (non-slip mats, adaptive utensils) and maintain family togetherness.

#### Eating at Gatherings

**Example — Chiu:** Chiu sleeps during the day and is difficult to wake for family meals. Rather than forcing Chiu awake, the family adapts meal times and keeps portions available for when Chiu is awake.

### 6.2 Lesson 2: Eating, Drinking and Preventing Health Problems

**Learning objectives:**
1. How to prevent weight loss?
2. How to prevent the person with dementia from eating or drinking things they should not?
3. How to prevent aspiration pneumonia?
4. How to keep the person hydrated?

#### Weight Loss Prevention

People in later stages of dementia often lose weight. Strategies:
- Be flexible with meal timing (adapt to when the person is awake and alert)
- Keep records of what and how often the person eats
- Ensure access to foods the person enjoys
- Consider what foods they enjoyed before diagnosis
- Offer frequent small meals and snacks rather than three large meals

#### Preventing Ingestion of Inedible Materials

People in late stages may develop altered judgement about what is safe to eat — consuming soaps, flowers, cleaning products, or sauces mistaken for drinks. This is part of the disease and cannot be "taught away."

**Essential safety measures:**
- Lock away household chemicals and cleaning products
- Keep inedible materials out of reach
- Monitor the person during meals
- Remove potentially dangerous items from accessible areas

#### Preventing Aspiration Pneumonia

People in late-stage dementia may develop swallowing difficulties (dysphagia). This is a serious, potentially fatal complication.

**Warning signs:** Difficulty swallowing, coughing when drinking, high temperature/fever

**Prevention:**
- Provide healthy soft foods
- Use thickened drinks (corn flour or commercial thickeners)
- Always position the person **upright** when eating and drinking
- Monitor during meals for signs of difficulty
- Consult healthcare provider if swallowing problems develop

#### Hydration

**Example — Ben and Mary:** Ben became severely dehydrated. Mary learned to ensure he drinks 8–10 glasses of water daily.

**Key hydration guidelines:**
- Encourage 6–8 glasses (or more) of water or juice per day (unless under fluid restriction)
- Record intake to track hydration
- Limit evening fluids to reduce nighttime toilet trips
- Prevent dehydration, which can cause confusion, urinary tract infections, and worsen cognitive symptoms

---

### 6.3 Lesson 3: Toileting and Continence Care

**Learning objectives:**
1. How can you help the person with dementia to use the toilet?
2. How to create a toilet routine?
3. Dealing with incontinence in public
4. Incontinence aids and equipment

#### Understanding Urinary Accidents

Dementia affects the ability to:
- Find the bathroom
- Identify the toilet
- Communicate the need to urinate
- Maintain bladder/bowel control
- Remember the steps involved in using the toilet

**The person should never be blamed or punished** — these accidents are part of the disease.

#### Environmental Modifications

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find toilet | Put picture of a toilet on the bathroom door |
| Can't see toilet | Use contrasting colour for toilet seat |
| Dark hallway at night | Install nightlights between bedroom and bathroom |
| Long distance to toilet | Provide bedside commode at night |
| Can't undo trousers | Switch to elastic-waist or easily removable pants |
| Forgets what to do | Provide step-by-step instructions posted in bathroom |
| Narrow doors for mobility aids | Modify doorways to accommodate walkers/wheelchairs |

#### Creating a Toileting Schedule

Using a **toilet diary** to track trips, accidents, and possible causes helps establish a regular schedule:
- Record times of toilet use and accidents
- Identify patterns based on the person's pre-dementia habits
- Schedule regular toilet trips (e.g., every 2 hours)
- Take the person to the toilet after meals and before bedtime
- Watch for non-verbal cues that the person needs the toilet

#### Dealing with Incontinence in Public

- Maintain regular toilet schedules
- Use the toilet before outings
- Carry spare clothing and supplies
- Know where toilets are located at destinations
- Use incontinence aids when going out

#### Incontinence Aids and Equipment

Before using aids, **consult a health professional** to identify treatable causes (e.g., urinary tract infection, medication side effects, constipation).

**Troubleshooting:**

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Person removes the pad | Check for discomfort, wrong size, need for changing |
| Leaking despite pad | Verify correct size, maintain toilet schedule |
| Skin irritation | Use correct size, change promptly, maintain genital hygiene, apply protective creams |
| Signs of infection (fever, pain, strong-smelling urine) | See doctor immediately, maintain hydration and genital care |

### 6.4 Lesson 4: Personal Care

**Learning objectives:**
1. How to help the person with dementia with bathing and washing?
2. How to help the person with dementia with getting dressed?
3. How to help the person with dementia with grooming, care of the mouth and dental care?

#### Bathing and Washing

- Follow the person's preferred routine (morning/evening, bath/shower)
- Ensure water temperature is safe
- Use non-slip mats and grab bars for safety
- Provide privacy — use towels to cover exposed areas
- Give step-by-step instructions
- Consider sponge baths as an alternative if full bathing becomes distressing
- Be patient and calm — anxiety about bathing is common in dementia
- Let the person do as much as possible independently
- Respect the person's modesty and dignity at all times

**Example — Neil and Amit:** Neil wants to help his father-in-law Amit take a bath before a doctor's visit. When Neil tugs Amit's arm and insists, Amit becomes angry and aggressive. The lesson teaches: never force bathing. Instead, approach calmly, explain what's happening, offer choices, try again later if the person refuses, and consider alternatives like a sponge bath.

#### Dressing

- Lay out clothes in the order they should be put on
- Reduce choices to 2–3 options (not open-ended)
- Choose comfortable, easy-to-manage clothing (elastic waists, Velcro closures, front-opening garments)
- Allow extra time
- Maintain the person's established preferences and style
- Break the dressing process into simple steps

#### Grooming and Dental Care

- Assist with hair care, shaving, nail care, and dental hygiene
- Maintain familiar routines
- Demonstrate or guide through steps
- Electric toothbrushes may be easier to use
- Regular dental visits remain important
- Keep grooming a pleasant, dignified experience

---

### 6.5 Lesson 5: An Enjoyable Day

**Learning objectives:**
1. How to plan activities at home for the person with dementia?
2. How to maintain the person with dementia's activities and interests outside the home?
3. How to adapt routines as dementia progresses?

#### Activity Planning Principles

- Base activities on the person's **lifelong interests and hobbies**
- **Adapt rather than abandon** activities as abilities change
- Maintain social connections and community involvement
- Balance activity with rest
- Structure the day with routine while allowing flexibility
- Break activities into simple, manageable steps
- Plan the most stimulating activities for the person's best time of day

#### Indoor Activities (All Stages)

Looking at photo albums, listening to music, simple puzzles, sorting objects, folding laundry, gardening in pots, simple cooking tasks, reminiscence activities, watching nature, playing with pets, simple arts and crafts, singing together, reading aloud, watching familiar TV programmes.

#### Maintaining Activities Outside the Home

**Example — Martha and Penny:** Martha enjoys going to the community centre but can no longer walk there alone.

- **Good:** Penny could walk with Martha, or ask a neighbour to accompany her
- **Good:** Penny could ask others outside the family (neighbours, friends) for concrete help
- **Bad:** Telling Martha to just watch TV at home — this isolates her and removes activities she enjoys (may be appropriate only in later stages when abilities change significantly)

#### Adapting Routines as Dementia Progresses

**Example — Martha and reading:** Martha loved reading but can no longer manage books independently.

- **Good:** Penny reads aloud to Martha for 15 minutes before bedtime — adapting the beloved activity
- **Good:** Getting books with more pictures than words, or audiobooks
- **Bad:** Taking books out of Martha's room — this fails to recognise how important reading is to her

## 7. MODULE 5: Dealing with Behaviour Changes (10 Lessons)

This is the most extensive module, covering the most challenging and distressing aspects of dementia caregiving.

### 7.1 Lesson 1: Introduction to Behaviour Changes

**Learning objectives:**
1. Behaviour changes that may be particularly stressful
2. Understanding the cycle of behaviour change
3. Different approaches to respond to behaviour changes

#### Why Behaviour Changes Happen

Dementia changes the way people behave, think or act. This is distressing for both the person living with dementia and their carers. **"Any behaviour that gets you or the person you care for upset is stressful."**

#### Eight Categories of Behaviour Change

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Memory loss | Forgetting or losing things, not recalling recent events, forgetting dates/days |
| Aggression | Talking or acting in a threatening way, making the carer feel frightened |
| Depression, anxiety, apathy | Sadness, worry, fear, frustration, anger, unusual emotionality, withdrawal, slow reactions |
| Difficulty sleeping | Restlessness at night, waking family members |
| Delusions and hallucinations | Fixed false beliefs, seeing/hearing things that aren't there, suspicion |
| Repetitive behaviour | Repeating questions or actions over and over |
| Walking and getting lost | Continuously walking around, leaving the house, getting lost |
| Changes in judgement | Saying wrong things at wrong times, acting inappropriately, not understanding limitations |

#### The Cycle of Behaviour Change (Core Concept)

The cycle has three parts:

1. **What happens before?** (the trigger)
2. **The behaviour** (the change)
3. **Carer's response** (the reaction)

**Example — Howard and Kayla:**
- *Before:* Howard asks Kayla questions about recent events (who visited, what she had for dinner)
- *Behaviour:* Kayla can't answer and becomes agitated
- *Response:* Howard feels frustrated

**Breaking the cycle:** By understanding this cycle, carers can intervene at any point:
- Change the trigger (stop asking memory-testing questions)
- Change the response (take a deep breath, remind yourself it's the disease)
- Or both

**Howard's possible responses:**

| Response | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| Show that he is frustrated | NOT good — increases agitation |
| Take a deep breath | GOOD — helps him respond calmly |
| Say "I already answered that, please stop bothering me" | NOT good — blames Kayla |
| Remind himself that Kayla has dementia and cannot help forgetting | GOOD — compassionate reframing |

#### Key Principles for All Behaviour Changes

- Identify what happens before the stressful behaviour to understand triggers
- Take a deep breath before responding
- Try different responses — the first one doesn't always work
- Seek professional help when you can't manage a situation
- Multiple approaches may be needed on different days
- Realize there will be better and worse days

---

### 7.2 Lesson 2: Memory Loss

**Learning objectives:**
1. Understanding memory loss in dementia
2. How to respond to memory loss
3. How to use memory aids

#### Understanding Memory Loss

People with dementia increasingly lose memory over time, starting with recent events, keys, wallets, phone numbers, dates, and appointments. Past memories (especially childhood) are often preserved longer.

#### Practical Strategies (Through Maya and Anne)

**For forgetting groceries:**
- GOOD: Create a memory aid together — a visible shopping list
- GOOD: Go shopping together
- GOOD: Ask a neighbour to accompany the person
- BAD: Don't just buy groceries yourself without involving the person
- BAD: Don't scold ("What's wrong with you?")

**For forgetting daily activities:**
- GOOD: Ask what they usually do on specific days (using established routines as anchors)
- GOOD: Write out to-do lists for each day
- GOOD: Talk through the day's plan on the phone
- BAD: Don't take over completely
- BAD: Don't show impatience

**For forgetting medication:**
- GOOD: Put notes near the clock
- GOOD: Use a pill box organized by day and time
- GOOD: Call daily to remind
- BAD: Don't blame ("How could you forget your medications?")
- BAD: Don't simply give up and cry

#### Memory Aids Recommended

Calendars, whiteboards, notes in visible locations, pill organizers, photo labels on drawers/cabinets, routine checklists, family diaries for recording events, written daily schedules, clocks with day/date displays.

---

### 7.3 Lesson 3: Aggression

**Learning objectives:**
1. Why does aggression happen?
2. How to respond to aggressive behaviour?
3. How to deal with ongoing aggression?

#### Why Aggression Happens

Aggression can happen for a variety of reasons:
- **Unmet needs** (pain, hunger, needing the toilet, overstimulation)
- **Illness** such as a urinary tract infection
- **Medication** combinations or side effects
- **Environmental factors** — something happening around the person
- **Difficulty understanding** others, judging social situations, controlling feelings, or expressing themselves
- **Personality or mental health changes** from the disease
- **Feeling autonomy is being threatened** — being forced to do things

**WARNING:** If the person is suddenly behaving aggressively, there may be an underlying cause (e.g., urinary infection) that should be investigated by a doctor.

#### The Neil and Amit Example

Neil wants Amit to bathe before a doctor's visit. Neil says "it is time for your bath." Amit refuses. Neil tugs Amit's arm: "You need to bathe because you're going to the doctor." Amit pulls back, resists. Neil tugs again, says angrily: "You must take a bath." Amit gets very angry, shouts, tries to shove Neil.

**Breaking down the cycle:**
- *Before:* Neil hurries Amit, tugs his arm, uses demanding tone
- *Behaviour:* Amit angrily refuses, shouts, tries to shove
- *Response:* Neil becomes upset

**What Neil could do instead:**
- Stay calm and approach gently
- Try different timing — ask later when Amit is calmer
- Offer a choice: "Would you like a bath or a sponge bath?"
- Make the environment calming (warm bathroom, soothing music)
- Never physically force the person

#### Responding to Aggression

- Stay calm — do not react with anger or force
- Identify potential triggers
- Give the person space if safe to do so
- Use a calm, reassuring tone
- Try to redirect attention to a different activity
- Remove potential hazards from the environment
- Maintain the person's dignity — don't force activities
- If one approach doesn't work, try another
- Never physically restrain unless there is immediate danger

#### Dealing with Ongoing Aggression

- Sometimes your first approach may not work — don't get discouraged
- Different responses may work at different times
- Take a deep breath and think about the most positive ways to respond
- Remind yourself that aggression can be a part of the disease, or a reaction to the disease
- Get suggestions from others in similar situations
- If the person continues to show aggression, consult the Alzheimer's Association in your country
- **Ask for professional help** if aggression becomes frequent, escalates, or poses danger

#### Lesson Review

- Aggression like shouting, shoving or pushing can happen to carers
- It can be very upsetting for both the person and the carer
- Try to change the environment to make it more calming
- Maintain the person's dignity — never force them
- If one approach doesn't work, try another
- Realize there may be worse and better moments
- Sudden aggression may indicate an underlying medical cause

### 7.4 Lesson 4: Depression, Anxiety, and Apathy

**Learning objectives:**
1. How to reduce depression in the person with dementia?
2. How to deal with anxiety?
3. How to respond to loss of interest in things?

#### Depression (Juan and Isabel)

People with dementia can experience genuine depression — sadness, withdrawal, crying, loss of interest.

**Responses:**
- GOOD: Walk over calmly, use reassuring tone: "I have some ideas for how you can feel better, let's talk"
- GOOD: Touch the person's arm/shoulder: "I know you feel bad, I do too. What we're going through is really hard"
- GOOD: Suggest doing a pleasant activity together
- BAD: Don't say "Just get up and do something"
- BAD: Don't shame ("Men don't cry")
- BAD: Don't walk away thinking nothing can be done

#### Anxiety (Benjamin and Grandmother Emma)

Anxiety manifests as restlessness, agitation, muttering, pacing, and repetitive movements.

**Responses:**
- GOOD: Think "She cannot help the way she behaves" — it's brain changes
- GOOD: Reassure the person they are safe with a warm smile
- GOOD: Engage them in a task or familiar activity
- GOOD: Reduce environmental stimuli (lower TV volume, use headphones)
- BAD: Don't give direct orders ("Sit down, you're making it impossible to watch my show")
- BAD: Don't ignore or turn away from the person

#### Apathy/Loss of Interest (George and Sofia)

People with dementia may lose interest in activities they previously enjoyed, becoming withdrawn and passive. Apathy is different from depression — it is a lack of motivation rather than sadness.

**Responses:**
- GOOD: Express love and suggest doing something together
- GOOD: Think back to what they used to enjoy and adapt those activities
- GOOD: Read the newspaper to them, cook their favourite dish, arrange a visit to familiar places
- GOOD: Start with very small, simple activities and build up
- BAD: Don't accuse of "laziness"
- BAD: Don't give up

#### When to Seek Professional Help

If depression, anxiety, or apathy persists, worsens significantly, or the person expresses hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm, consult a medical professional immediately.

---

### 7.5 Lesson 5: Difficulty Sleeping

**Learning objectives:**
1. Understanding sleeping difficulties in dementia
2. How to deal with a person who wakes up in the middle of the night

#### Understanding Sleep Difficulties

Many people with dementia experience changes in sleep patterns — difficulty falling asleep, frequent night waking, excessive daytime napping, or being restless at night. This disrupts not only the person's rest but the carer's sleep, which can severely impact the carer's ability to provide care.

#### Strategies for Helping the Person Fall Asleep

**Example — Grace and Rosie:** Rosie is sent to bed at 20:00 so the family can do activities together. Rosie has trouble falling asleep and opens/shuts dresser drawers noisily, keeping Grace awake.

**Effective strategies:**
- Go for walks and add more physical activity during the day
- Ensure no coffee or too much fluid a few hours before bed (coffee/tea keep people awake; fluids cause frequent urination)
- Make lunch the bigger meal of the day (light dinner makes sleeping easier)
- Limit daytime naps to 15–30 minutes
- Play soothing music before bedtime
- Create a bedtime routine (lowering lights, washing face and teeth, changing into pajamas)
- Keep in mind that some people require less sleep (6–8 hours from 20:00 means waking between 02:00–04:00)
- Do NOT give sleeping pills (can make dementia confusion worse and may become addictive)

#### Dealing with Night Waking

**Example — Vani and Geeta:** At 3:00 AM, Vani wakes up, paces the house, wakes Geeta and asks "Where are we? I want to go home." Geeta yells "I can't take this anymore."

**Effective strategies:**
- Understand what helps the person sleep (dark room vs. night light, soft music vs. silence)
- Give the person a favourite object to relax (blanket, stuffed animal)
- Schedule a doctor's appointment to rule out medical causes (urinary tract infection, pain, medication causing hallucinations)
- Develop an activity schedule to keep the person awake and busy during the day
- Encourage physical exercise during the day
- Ask if they need the bathroom, or are hungry or thirsty — then help meet those needs
- NEVER physically take hold of and put the person back in bed (violates dignity, may cause agitation or anger)
- Ask for help from family members, friends, or paid professionals — eventually, lack of sleep can affect anyone's ability to provide care

**When the person wakes at night:**
- Stay calm and focus on helping them sleep, rather than reacting emotionally
- Gently remind them it is dark outside and time to sleep
- Play soothing music
- Read aloud — a calming poem, story, or book
- Sing a song or chant together
- Pray or meditate together for 15 minutes
- Comfort them physically — give a stuffed animal, hug, or hold them until they fall asleep

#### Key Takeaways

- Try to identify circumstances that increase sleep difficulty and address them
- When one approach doesn't work, try another
- Realize there will be good and bad days
- Difficulty sleeping is part of the disease
- Ask for help — it is hard to provide good care on limited sleep

---

### 7.6 Lesson 6: Delusions and Hallucinations

**Learning objectives:**
1. Why do people with dementia have unreal thoughts and see/hear things that aren't there?
2. How to stop or reduce delusions and hallucinations?

#### Understanding Delusions and Hallucinations

People with dementia may not understand the world around them because of changes in their brain.

**Delusion:** A fixed false belief. For example, the person may believe they are under threat or harm from the carer. To the person, the error in thinking is very real, causes fear, and may result in distressing self-protective behaviours.

**Hallucination:** Seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that are not there. For example, seeing a deceased relative in the room.

These are caused by brain changes from the disease. They are **very real** to the person experiencing them.

#### Responding to Delusions and Hallucinations

- **Never argue** with or try to convince the person that what they perceive isn't real
- Acknowledge the person's feelings and provide reassurance
- Respond with calm, compassion, and understanding
- Look for environmental triggers (shadows, reflections, noise, cluttered spaces)
- Gently distract — redirect attention to a different activity
- Consult a doctor — delusions/hallucinations may be caused by medication side effects, infections, or other treatable conditions
- Ensure glasses and hearing aids work correctly (poor vision/hearing can contribute)
- Reduce clutter and shadows in the environment
- Turn off violent or upsetting TV programmes (person may think events are happening in the room)
- Ensure the person is safe and can't reach anything harmful

#### Key Principles

- Delusions and hallucinations are part of the disease
- The person cannot control them
- Your role is to provide safety, comfort, and reassurance
- Never dismiss or ridicule what the person experiences
- Professional help should be sought if episodes are frequent, frightening, or cause the person to act in dangerous ways

---

### 7.7 Lesson 7: Repetitive Behaviour

**Learning objectives:**
1. Understanding why repetitive behaviour happens
2. How to respond to repetitive questions and actions

#### Understanding Repetitive Behaviour

People with dementia may repeat questions, phrases, or actions over and over. This is caused by the disease, not by choice. The person cannot remember that they already asked or did something.

#### Responding to Repetitive Behaviour

- **Stay patient and calm** — the person is not doing this on purpose
- Avoid scolding — this is part of the disease
- Answer repeated questions with the same reassurance each time
- Redirect to a different activity
- Address underlying needs (the repetition may signal anxiety, boredom, or insecurity)
- Turn the repetitive action into a useful task (if rubbing hands on table, provide a dish cloth)
- Use memory aids (notes, clocks, calendars, pictures) to answer repeated questions
- Reassure: "It's OK. I love you. I'll take care of it."
- Ignore the behaviour if it's harmless and let it go
- Talk to a doctor — some medications may cause repetitive actions

---

### 7.8 Lesson 8: Walking and Getting Lost (Wandering)

**Learning objectives:**
1. Understanding why people with dementia walk and get lost
2. How to reduce the risk of getting lost

#### Understanding Wandering

People with dementia may continuously walk around, leave the house, and become lost. Causes include:
- Looking for something or someone familiar
- Boredom
- Feeling uneasy or anxious
- Following established routines (trying to "go to work")
- Disorientation about time and place

#### Safety Strategies

**Home safety:**
- Make the area safe — remove clutter, area rugs, and obstacles
- Lock doors and windows
- Put a gate across stairs
- Put a bell on doors to warn when someone is leaving
- Place locks at the top of doors where the person probably won't notice them
- Disguise doors/doorknobs
- Put away items that may trigger leaving (car keys, coats, bags)

**Identification and tracking:**
- Use ID bracelets or cards with the person's name, condition, and emergency contact
- Maintain a recent photo of the person
- Notify neighbours and local services that the person has dementia
- Consider GPS tracking devices or MedicAlert enrolment
- Inform local police about the person's condition

**Engagement strategies:**
- Give the person something to do — help with cleaning, vacuuming, sweeping
- Plan regular safe walks as part of the daily routine
- Ensure the person gets enough physical activity during the day
- Address the underlying need if identifiable

---

### 7.9 Lesson 9: Changes in Judgement

**Learning objectives:**
1. What are changes in judgement?
2. How to manage minor changes in judgement
3. How to deal with more serious changes in judgement

#### Understanding Changes in Judgement

Dementia can affect a person's ability to make appropriate judgements — saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, acting inappropriately, not understanding their own limitations, making poor financial decisions, or driving unsafely.

#### Managing Minor Changes

- Be patient and understanding
- Gently redirect when the person says or does something inappropriate
- Don't embarrass the person in front of others
- Explain the situation to others if needed

#### Managing Serious Changes

**Financial decisions (Example — Sophie and Julia):**
Sophie may still be able to pay bills if given the right prompts (opening bills in front of her, cueing one at a time). Alternatively, find out whether Sophie has someone who handles her finances. If she isn't getting help, alert a family member. Do not simply take over without the person's involvement.

**Driving (Example — Hugo and Pablo):**
Hugo nearly causes an accident.

- GOOD: Stay calm and offer Hugo a ride if he needs to go somewhere
- GOOD: Ask Hugo if he would like help figuring out transportation
- GOOD: Tell Hugo honestly that you are concerned about his driving and suggest visiting his doctor
- GOOD: Report the incident to Hugo's carer, friend, or family member
- BAD: Immediately seize Hugo's car keys (he may become angry, and Pablo can't decide for Hugo)
- BAD: Ignore the situation (Hugo's driving may harm himself and others)

**Inappropriate sexual behaviour (Example — Mateo and Camila):**
Mateo makes inappropriate advances toward his carer Camila during bathing.

- GOOD: Stay calm and tell Mateo the behaviour is unacceptable; explain who Camila is
- GOOD: Change the bathing situation — sponge bath so Mateo can do more himself
- GOOD: Change the environment — put a towel/robe over Mateo's shoulders for privacy

The family does not overreact because they remember it is the disease, but they redefine appropriate boundaries for Camila's safety.

#### Key Principles for Changes in Judgement

- Make adjustments gradually and respectfully
- Arrange legal and financial protections early (powers of attorney)
- Balance safety with autonomy and dignity
- Consult professionals when needed
- Monitor the situation over time — judgement changes may worsen gradually

---

### 7.10 Lesson 10: Putting It All Together

**Learning objectives:** Synthesizing all strategies from Module 5 and cross-referencing earlier modules.

#### Key Messages

This lesson brings together the strategies learned across all 10 lessons of Module 5 and connects them back to Modules 2, 3, and 4:

1. **Don't blame yourself** — behaviour changes are caused by the disease
2. **Don't blame the person with dementia** — they cannot control these changes
3. **Share your feelings with others** — isolation makes everything harder (Module 2, Lesson 4: Involving Others)
4. **Make time for yourself** — this is essential, not optional (Module 3: Caring for Me)
5. **Use the Cycle of Behaviour Change** to systematically analyze and respond to challenging situations
6. **Try multiple approaches** — what works one day may not work the next
7. **Seek professional help** when needed — you don't have to manage everything alone
8. **Refer back to earlier modules** for stress management (Module 3, Lesson 1), communication (Module 2, Lesson 2), and cognitive reframing (Module 3, Lesson 3)

---

## 8. Core Principles of the Entire Manual

1. **Dementia is a disease, not a character flaw or normal aging** — all behaviours are symptoms
2. **Carer well-being is equally important as the person's** — self-care is necessary for sustained caregiving
3. **Dignity and respect must be maintained always** — never talk about the person as if they are not present, never infantilize, never use "baby talk"
4. **You cannot do it alone** — involving others is a strength, not a weakness
5. **Thoughts shape feelings** — cognitive reframing is a powerful tool for emotional management
6. **Plan early** — legal, financial, and care preferences should be discussed while the person can participate
7. **Adapt, don't fight** — strategies must evolve as the disease progresses
8. **Evidence-based approaches work** — the programme is grounded in WHO mhGAP guidelines
9. **The person with dementia has rights** — including the right to participate in decisions, to grieve, and to be treated with compassion
10. **Relaxation and self-care are not luxuries** — they are essential tools for long-term caregiving

---

## 9. Critical Communication Principles (Consolidated)

These principles appear throughout the manual and form the foundation of all interactions:

- Approach from the front, identify yourself
- Address by preferred name
- Speak slowly, calmly, using short simple words
- Allow time to respond (count to 5 between phrases)
- Focus on feelings, not facts
- Use a comforting, warm tone
- Be patient, flexible, and understanding
- Don't interrupt (they may lose their train of thought)
- Allow them to interrupt you (or they may forget what they want to say)

## 12. Relevance for Digital Health Applications

The WHO iSupport manual provides a gold-standard framework for evidence-based carer support, making it highly relevant for digital health platforms:

- **Validated modular curriculum structure** adaptable for digital delivery
- **Culturally adaptable content** designed for international use across diverse contexts
- **Comprehensive intervention library** spanning communication, self-care, daily care, and behavioural management
- **Pedagogical model** combining psychoeducation + cognitive-behavioural techniques + practical skills training
- **Co-equal emphasis** on patient care AND carer well-being
- **Evidence grounding** in WHO mhGAP guidelines — suitable for regulatory pathways (e.g., DiGA in Germany, NICE in UK)
- **Structured scenario-driven learning** with self-assessment tools and relaxation techniques
- **Template for adaptation** — explicitly designed to be localized to national contexts
- **Ideal reference** for digital health platforms delivering accessible, personalized dementia care support at scale
