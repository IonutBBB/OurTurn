        "q1": "Kas ir OurTurn?",
        "a1": "OurTurn ir ģimenes aprūpes koordinācijas lietotne, kas palīdz organizēt ikdienas rutīnu mīļotajam, kurš dzīvo ar demenci. Tā ietver divas savienotas lietotnes — vienkāršu jūsu mīļotajam un jaudīgu jums.",
        "q2": "Vai OurTurn ir medicīniska lietotne?",
        "a2": "Nē. OurTurn ir labsajūtas un ikdienas dzīves atbalsta lietotne. Tā palīdz ģimenēm organizēt rutīnu un uzturēt saikni, taču tā nav medicīniska ierīce un nediagnosticē, neārstē un neuzrauga nekādu stāvokli. Medicīnisku jautājumu gadījumā vienmēr konsultējieties ar savu veselības aprūpes sniedzēju.",
        "q3": "Kā darbojas Aprūpes kods?",
        "a3": "Kad izveidojat savu kontu, OurTurn ģenerē unikālu 6 ciparu Aprūpes kodu. Jūsu mīļotais šo kodu ievada vienreiz savā ierīcē — bez parolēm, bez kontiem, bez apjukuma. Abas lietotnes paliek savienotas automātiski.",
        "q4": "Vai manam mīļotajam ir jāizveido konts?",
        "a4": "Nē. Jūsu mīļotais vienkārši ievada Aprūpes kodu vienreiz. Nav jāreģistrējas, nav e-pasta, nav jāatceras parole. Lietotne ir izstrādāta, lai būtu pēc iespējas vienkāršāka.",
        "q5": "Vai var pievienoties citi ģimenes locekļi?",
        "a5": "Jā! Ar OurTurn Plus jūs varat uzaicināt neierobežotu skaitu ģimenes locekļu savā ģimenes lokā. Ikviens var redzēt dienas plānu, dalīties ar dienasgrāmatas piezīmēm un saņemt atjauninājumus.",
        "q6": "Kā darbojas atrašanās vietas koplietošana?",
        "a6": "Ar jūsu mīļotā piekrišanu OurTurn izmanto viņa/viņas tālruņa atrašanās vietu, lai parādītu jums, kur viņš/viņa atrodas kartē. Jūs varat iestatīt drošās zonas un saņemt maigus paziņojumus, ja viņš/viņa atstāj pazīstamu zonu.",
        "q7": "Kas ir AI aprūpes konsultants?",
        "a7": "AI aprūpes konsultants ir atbalstošs tērzēšanas asistents, kas palīdz jums ar ikdienas aprūpes idejām, aktivitāšu ieteikumiem un vispārīgiem norādījumiem. Tas ir kā zinošs draugs, kas pieejams jebkurā laikā — taču tas nav ārsts un vienmēr mudina jūs konsultēties ar veselības aprūpes speciālistiem medicīnisku jautājumu gadījumā.",
        "q8": "Vai manas ģimenes dati ir drošībā?",
        "a8": "Jā. Mēs nopietni uztveram privātumu. Jūsu dati tiek šifrēti, droši glabāti un nekad netiek pārdoti trešajām personām. Jūs varat eksportēt vai dzēst savus datus jebkurā laikā no iestatījumu lapas. Pilnu informāciju skatiet mūsu Privātuma politikā.",
        "q9": "Vai es varu izmēģināt OurTurn pirms maksāšanas?",
        "a9": "Protams. OurTurn Plus nāk ar bezmaksas 14 dienu izmēģinājuma periodu — nav nepieciešama kredītkarte. Bezmaksas plāns ir pieejams arī uz visiem laikiem ar pamatfunkcijām.",
        "q10": "Kādās ierīcēs darbojas OurTurn?",
        "a10": "Aprūpētāja lietotne darbojas tīmekļa pārlūkprogrammās, iPhone un Android tālruņos. Lietotne jūsu mīļotajam darbojas iPhone un Android tālruņos."
